    You're playing down in the basement of your home, just like you do most days.
    As you walk across the room to pick up one of your cars, you see a trap door
    in the floor. You've never noticed it before, and you wonder what you might
    see if you opened it.

    This seems like something a grownup should know about, so you head upstairs.
    Uncle Chris is sitting in the kitchen, eating his lunch of chicken and broccoli.
    You tell him about the door, and ask him if you can open it.

    "Your parents would probably want us to leave it alone. But really, they shouldn't
    have left me in charge. Let's go see what's down there."

    You and Uncle Chris go back to the basement and open the trap door. You see stairs
    leading down into the dark.

    You open the trap door and see stairs leading down. You carefully walk down the stairs.
    There are lots of stairs; it seems to take forever. You eventually get to the bottom,
    but it's completely dark; you can't see anything. It might be a good idea to go back
    for a flashlight, but it's a long walk back up the stairs.

    You start the long climb back up the stairs. As you get to the top, you see Uncle Chris
    standing at the top of the stairs, shining a flashlight down.

    "Your parents probably wouldn't want you down there. It looks kind of cool, though, and
    they really shouldn't have left me in charge. Let's see what's down there."

    Even though you can't really see anything, you start blindy walking in the dark. You take
    a few steps, then bump your nose on the wall. Holding your nose and feeling rather silly,
    you decide to go back upstairs to get a flashlight.

    When you get to the bottom of the stairs, Uncle Chris shines his flashlight around. A long,
    winding passage is in front of you. You start walking, shivering from the cold air.

    After a few minutes, you see a softly glowing door. As you walk up to it, you see words
    carved into the door.

    "Adventure and danger lie beyond this door. Only those with the heart of a hero dare open it."

    Adventure sure sounds like fun, but danger? Maybe this isn't such a good idea. You wonder if
    you should wait until your parents get home.

    You tell Uncle Chris that you want to wait for your parents to get home.

    "Yeah, that's probably a good idea," he says. "I don't want to make your mom mad."

    You and Uncle Chris go back up the stairs to your basement. You walk over to get your
    toy car, and turn around to look at the trap door again. But it's gone.

    Uncle Chris notices that the trap door disappeared, too. "I guess it's probably better that
    it's gone, anyway. We probably would have gotten in trouble down there. Still, I wonder what
    was behind that glowing door..."

    You and Uncle Chris grab the door handle and pull it open. Through the opening, you see a huge
    room with stone walls and columns; it looks like the inside of a castle. Before you can decide
    if it's a good idea to step in, a strong wind pushes you and Uncle Chris through the doorway.

    You stumble in, and the door slams shut behind you. You wonder if the door will open again, but
    you don't have a chance to check; you notice that dozens of people are looking at you, including
    an older man wearing a crown.

    "Thank heavens you're here! You must be the heroes that the sorceress spoke of!"

    Uncle Chris looks at you, shrugs, and says "Uh, yeah, that's us. The heroes."

    TODO this needs to be broken up somehow

    "Well," says the king, "you've arrived just in time. A terrible dragon is attacking our kindgom.
    He's burning our crops, smashing our houses, and eating our livestock! The good sorceress told us
    that two heroes would come to save us, but my daughter, Princess Bethany, refused to wait. She
    took off to fight the dragon on her own."

    "I will give you our fastest gryphon. Find Princess Bethany before she gets to the dragon, and bring
    her back to the castle. Then we will come up with a plan to defeat the dragon."

    You climb aboard the gryphon, but there is only room for one person. "You go ahead," says Uncle Chris.
    "The king has some jars he can't get open, so I'm going to take care of that."

    The gryphon sure is big. You aren't sure if this is such a good idea.

    You wrap your arms around the gryphon, and say "Let's go!" The gryphon flaps its wings and leaps into the air.

    Before you know it, you're soaring high above the ground and quickly flying away from the castle. In a couple
    minutes, you can't even see the castle anymore. You're so far in the air that you almost don't see the horse
    galloping on the ground below you. That must be Princess Bethany!

    You could tell the gryphon to land in front of her, or you could just keep going and stop the dragon yourself.

    You start to climb down, but suddenly the gryphon flaps its wings and leaps into the air. You hold on
    as tight as you can as the gryphon climbs into the sky.

    The gryphon lands in the middle of the road, blocking Princess Bethany's path. She charges her horse right up
    to you, glaring angrily.

    "So, my father sent you to stop me, did he? Well, everyone else is afraid to stop this dragon, so I'm going to do
    it myself. Or," she says, drawing her sword, "you can try to stop me. I wouldn't recommend it, though."

    The king gave you a sword, but Princess Bethany looks pretty indimidating. You would probably have an easier time
    fighting the dragon. You could just fly ahead of her and fight the dragon before she shows up, but maybe you
    and the princess could work together to stop the dragon.
